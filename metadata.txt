about=OrangePeel is a plugin that visualizes the scale distortion on a given region on a given projection. This tool algorithmically creates a grid of points over a given region and calculates the scale factor at each of these points. The points are then used in making a heat map that visualize the gradient of change in scale distortion over that region.
